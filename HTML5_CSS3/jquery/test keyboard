I paid 5 years for a wrong decision. When I was 18, my life like a tree in the fully foggy mountain. I didn't know what do I really want ?. I passed an exam to university, spent 5 boring years to finish it. The day <b>I became an ECE (electronic and communication engineering) engineer</b>, while a lot of people happily was taking photos with their family... I just received graduation certificate and quietly went home ...no family, no friend, no flowers and no pride. Because I know in that 5 years I didn't get many knowledge. I lost my confidence and didn't deserve praise.</p>
                                <p class="lead"><b>I got a job</b> and quickly realized <b>it not suitable with me</b>. <b>After 6 month, I decided to quit my job and have been focusing on learning programming</b>. That was the thing that made me most excited, during university years. Some people think that I'm crazy, some people think that I'm stupid but I happy with my first decision.</p>
                                <p class="lead"><b>I have been studying "Java Full Stack" course in Softech Aptech Da Nang. I will finishit in the next 5 or 6 months. And I hopefully will be joined Internship Program of your company.</b></p>
